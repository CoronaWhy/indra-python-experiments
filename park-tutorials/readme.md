# My Experiments with the tutorials


## Intentions
These experiments are just baby steps to learn the massive Indra ecosystem (and, I'll confess, learn Python).

# Experiments
From time to time, I might create directories for outputs of these experiments for further study.

### indra9.py
This processes an array of PMCIds all the way through filtering and accumulating the final Statements in a single JSON file, as well as an HTML file for browsing.

Note that it is using the online version of Reach. There is a more up-to-date version of Reach which can be built and used by supplying the additional URL parameter to Reach.

### indra10.py
This is an experiment using PubMed search terms to collect Statements. It is incomplete since it does not go the whole distance and perform filtering.
